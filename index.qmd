I am a graduate from Vindhya Institute of Science and Technology, Indore, pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. My passion lies in compiler development and system programming, particularly with LLVM. I enjoy programming, exploring new technologies, and contributing to open-source projects. Currently, I'm focused on areas like LLVM IR, optimizations, and the design and implementation of programming languages.
